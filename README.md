# BDB2022 Capstone Project

This capstone project will be an application of what you've learned from the two courses of BDB2022. There are three DApp projects for you to choose. You only need to select one. It's up to you as well if you'd like to do this capstone project alone, or with a team. Working with a team limits up to 3 members only.

## Setup
1. Clone this repository by running git clone. 
	```
	git clone https://github.com/sparklearnedtech/bdb2022-capstone.git
	```
2. Create your own branch, checkout, and make sure you are not on main branch.
	```
	git branch team-xyz    // create branch using the firstname-lastname format if individual, or your team name if by group
	git checkout team-xyz  // checkout on the newly created branch
	git branch             // check and make sure you are currently on your team-xyz branch, not main
	```
3. As you can see, this repo only contains the `README.md` file. It's up to you to generate a new React JS project on your branch after you've chosen what type of DApp project you'd be working on.
4. Once you're done, just ping mentors [@harveyjavier](https://github.com/harveyjavier) and [@aldrickb](https://github.com/aldrickb) on `ðŸ”’bdb2022` Slack channel, and they will check you or your team's branch.

## Select from these type of DApp projects

### NFT Marketplace
Deploy your own set of ERC721s or NFTs on testnet, and create your own marketplace for it. More like an e-commerce website for NFTs. It must have a _Connect wallet_ function, and purchase of the NFTs should be in ETH.

### Pool Staking
Deploy your own ERC20 token, and a staking pool contract on testnet. Then integrate it to a DApp. It must have a _Connect wallet_ function, and staking should have an accurate formula.

### Simple Game
Deploy your own set of ERC721/s or NFT/s on testnet. Then integrate these NFTs in a game. A simple arcade or hypercasual game will do. But make it fun. Game must have a _Connect wallet_ function, and only address that holds your deployed NFT can play.

_For the Blockchain network, strictly testnets only. You can use the variety of testnets available for Ethereum like Ropsten, Rinkeby, and Goerli._
